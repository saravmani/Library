```py
from typing import Annotated
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

# Define a custom TypedDict that includes a list of messages with add_messages reducer
class CustomMessagesState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    added_key_1: str
    added_key_2: str
    # etc

# Use MessagesState, which includes the messages key with add_messages reducer
class ExtendedMessagesState(MessagesState):
    # Add any keys needed beyond messages, which is pre-built 
    added_key_1: str
    added_key_2: str
    # etc
```

this both are same CustomMessagesState  and ExtendedMessagesState
